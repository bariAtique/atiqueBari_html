            <h1>My Professional Skill Set:</h1>
            <h2>A Decade of Analytical Excellence and Full-Stack Innovation</h2>

            <p>
              With over ten years of hands-on experience in the financial sector
              as an MIS Officer, combined with formal training in Data Science
              and MERN Stack development, I bring a powerful blend of analytical
              expertise, programming capability, and full-stack engineering to
              solve complex business challenges and build impactful digital
              solutions. My journey has been shaped by a deep passion for data,
              automation, and modern web technologies—skills that empower me to
              transform raw information into actionable insights and ideas into
              robust applications.
            </p>

            <h2>Excel & Financial Data Expertise</h2>

            <p>
              My professional foundation was built in the finance industry,
              where I spent a decade mastering
              <b>Management Information Systems (MIS)</b>. Working in a
              fast-paced financial environment taught me the importance of
              precision, speed, and data-driven decision making. Over the years,
              I became an expert in:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Advanced Excel automation, including formulas, conditional
                logic, lookup functions, data cleaning, and dashboard building.
              </li>

              <li>
                Designing and managing 30+ column datasets with thousands of
                rows.
              </li>

              <li>
                Creating macros and scripts to support financial reporting,
                reconciliation, and business intelligence.
              </li>

              <li>
                Streamlining month-end and day-end processes using automated
                tools.
              </li>

              <li>
                Ensuring data accuracy, validation, and audit-friendly
                documentation.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This extensive experience allows me to bridge the gap between raw
              operational data and meaningful business insights.
            </p>

            <h2>Data Science & Analytical Tools</h2>

            <p>
              To convert data into deeper value, I expanded my technical skills
              through certified training in
              <b>Data Science and Data Analysis</b>. Today, I am confident
              working with industry-standard analytical tools and environments
              such as:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Python for data cleaning, automation, exploration, and
                visualization.
              </li>

              <li>Pandas & NumPy for efficient data manipulation at scale.</li>

                database management.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              My analytical skill set enables me to understand business problems
              not just from the surface level but from a quantitative,
              evidence-driven perspective.
