            <p>
              As an MIS Officer in the Credit Card Department, I was responsible
              for managing, analyzing, and transforming data into actionable
              insights that supported strategic decision-making for top
              management. My role required strong analytical skills, advanced
              Excel knowledge, and the ability to work with large datasets with
              accuracy and efficiency.
            </p>

            <p>
              I consistently ensured the smooth flow of information between
              sales teams, operations, and senior leadership. By preparing
              daily, weekly, and monthly performance reports, I helped
              management monitor key indicators such as acquisition trends,
              productivity, approval ratios, incentive performance, and
              portfolio growth.
            </p>

            <p>
              I played a critical role in designing automated templates,
              dashboards, and MIS processes that minimized manual work and
              reduced report-preparation time. My responsibilities also included
              data validation, error checking, documentation, and maintaining
              confidentiality of sensitive financial and customer information.
            </p>

            <p>
              My contribution helped improve operational transparency, optimize
              incentive structures for the credit card sales team, and enhance
              the overall decision-making process for the department.
